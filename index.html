    A History of Light
    <br>
    BY MARK KIRSCHEN
    <br>
    <center> <i> <b>Through the telescope:
      Crater of the moon
      The rings around Saturn</b>
      <br>

      
      A light floating in
      Radio waves of the first explosion
      
      As I stepped back, an image
      Quick constellation of a figure
      I knew
      Traced itself for a moment
      Among the night sky fires
      
      I remembered the search
      For a lost girl, years before
      In the forests of upstate New York:
      
      How we looked down thin paths
      Ended by walls of mist
      Lacing itself in layers between
      The trees
      
      How we were thanked and sent
      Away: only the locals would keep looking
      
      Now I had found her
      But could never bring her back:
      The angle of sight lost
      
      Light-years between her fingertips:
      I had found her
      But can never bring her back
